# NeptuneTrial | Custom fishing trial plugin

Replaces the boring vanilla fishing.

* Fishes will now have a quality and a weight.
* The higher the quality, the higher the saturation.
* The higher the weight, the more food level it restores.
* To find out the quality of your fish, use the command '/appraise'.
* The heaviest fish a player catches is stored in a database.
